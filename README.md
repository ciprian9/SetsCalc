# SetsCalc
A calculator that also allows sets to be computed

Some of the functions like cartisian_product have some bugs when computing with an answer from a previous operation.
Feel free to modify anything and use the program if it helps. The dist folder contains the .exe file while the .py is just for
those with the knowledge that might be able to fix the bugs that I haven't figured out yet
